## The EMU programme {background-color="#0C2340"}

::: incremental
-   What is the legacy of the EMU?
-   What were the main topics taught in the EMU and how did those topics evolve over the years?

## Methods: approach

![The intuition behind an LDA model (Blei, 2012)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tanveer-Tarray/publication/334132970/figure/fig1/AS:776593391755269@1562165701867/llustration-of-Probabilistic-Topic-Models-FromBlei-D-2012.ppm){fig-align="center"}

## Methods: data {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   PDFs and written consent from the authors obtained for **68 theses** (71% of all theses), including at least one thesis <br> from all graduation years between 2007-2021
-   An average of **23,000 words** <br>per thesis
-   Written (mostly) **in English**

## Methods: pre-processing {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   PDF text extraction → `text_raw`
-   Removal of hyphenation, page numbers, titles, author names → `text_clean`
-   Unique identifier for each thesis → `ID`
-   Selection of relevant metadata → `title`, `grad_year`, `loc`, `lat`, `lon`
:::

## Methods: topic model {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  Tokens: words + concatenated bigrams and trigrams
2.  Stop words: Snowball lexicon + custom global, subject and document stopwords + lemmatisation → **N = 740,839 words**
3.  DTM with global frequencies \>5, resulting in a vocabulary **V = 6,601 words**
4.  LDA with **K = 5** qualitatively defined topics
